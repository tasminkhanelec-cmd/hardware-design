### Design a finite state machine that controls a 10-LED display with the following requirements:

- Initially all LEDs are off
- On first button press, randomly illuminate one of the odd-positioned LEDs (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
- On second button press, randomly illuminate one of the even-positioned LEDs (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Further button presses alternate between odd and even random patterns
